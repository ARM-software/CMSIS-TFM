# Trusted Firmware M user guide
How to compile and run TF-M and example test application for CoreLink SSE-200
subsystem on the MPS2 board and on the Fast Model(FVP).

Follow [build instruction](./tfm_build_instruction.md) to build the binaries.
Follow [secure boot](./tfm_secure_boot.md) to build the binaries with or without
BL2 bootloader.

## Execute TF-M example and regression tests on MPS2 boards and FVP ##
The BL2 bootloader and TF-M example application and tests run correctly on
SMM-SSE-200 for MPS2 (AN521) and on the Fixed Virtual Platform model
FVP_MPS2_AEMv8M version 11.2.23.

### To run the example code on FVP_MPS2_AEMv8M
Using FVP_MPS2_AEMv8M provided by DS-5 v5.27.1.

*FVP reference guide can be found
[here](https://developer.arm.com/docs/100966/latest)*

#### Example application and regression tests without BL2 bootloader
Add `tfm_s.axf` and `tfm_ns.axf` to symbol files in Debug Configuration menu.
```
<DS5_PATH>/sw/models/bin/FVP_MPS2_AEMv8M  \
--parameter fvp_mps2.platform_type=2 \
--parameter cpu0.baseline=0 \
--parameter cpu0.INITVTOR_S=0x10000000 \
--parameter cpu0.semihosting-enable=0 \
--parameter fvp_mps2.DISABLE_GATING=0 \
--parameter fvp_mps2.telnetterminal0.start_telnet=1 \
--parameter fvp_mps2.telnetterminal1.start_telnet=0 \
--parameter fvp_mps2.telnetterminal2.start_telnet=0 \
--parameter fvp_mps2.telnetterminal0.quiet=0 \
--parameter fvp_mps2.telnetterminal1.quiet=1 \
--parameter fvp_mps2.telnetterminal2.quiet=1 \
--application cpu0=<build_dir>/install/outputs/fvp/tfm_s.axf \
--data cpu0=<build_dir>/install/outputs/fvp/tfm_ns.bin@0x00100000

```

#### Example application and regression tests with BL2 bootloader
To test TF-M with bootloader, one must apply the following changes:

* Add `mcuboot.axf` to symbol files in DS-5 in Debug Configuration menu.
* Replace the last two lines of the previous command with this:
```
--application cpu0=<build_dir>/install/outputs/fvp/mcuboot.axf \
--data cpu0=<build_dir>/install/outputs/fvp/tfm_s_ns_signed.bin@0x10080000
```

#### Test software upgrade with BL2 bootloader
BL2 bootloader is mandatory to test software update. Furthermore two TF-M blob
must be built. Outputs of example application and regression test can be used to
test it. Load output of example application to slot 0 (0x10080000) and output of
regression test to slot 1 (0x10180000). Add the following line to the
end of the previous chapter:
```
--data cpu0=<build_dir>/install/outputs/fvp/tfm_s_ns_signed.bin@0x10180000
```

### To run the example code on SSE 200 FPGA on MPS2 board
FPGA image is available to download [here](https://developer.arm.com/products/system-design/development-boards/cortex-m-prototyping-systems/mps2)

To run BL2 bootloader and TF-M example application and tests in the MPS2 board,
it is required to have SMM-SSE-200 for MPS2 (AN521) image in the MPS2 board
SD card. The image should be located in
`<MPS2 device name>/MB/HBI0263<board revision letter>/AN521`

The MPS2 board tested is HBI0263C referred also as MPS2+.

`Note: If you change the exe names, MPS2 expects file names in 8.3 format.`

#### Example application

1. Copy `mcuboot.bin` and `tfm_sign.bin` files from
   `<build_dir>/install/outputs/AN521/` to `<MPS2 device name>/SOFTWARE/`
2. Open `<MPS2 device name>/MB/HBI0263C/AN521/images.txt`
3. Update the `AN521/images.txt` file as follows:
```
TITLE: Versatile Express Images Configuration File
[IMAGES]
TOTALIMAGES: 2                     ;Number of Images (Max: 32)
IMAGE0ADDRESS: 0x10000000
IMAGE0FILE: \Software\mcuboot.bin  ; BL2 bootloader
IMAGE1ADDRESS: 0x10080000
IMAGE1FILE: \Software\tfm_sign.bin ; TF-M example application binary blob
```
4. Close `<MPS2 device name>/MB/HBI0263C/AN521/images.txt`
5. Unmount/eject the `<MPS2 device name>` unit
6. Reset the board to execute the TF-M example application
7. After completing the procedure you should be able to visualize on the serial
   port (baud 115200 8n1) the following messages:


```
[INF] Starting bootloader
[INF] Image 0: magic=good, copy_done=0xff, image_ok=0xff
[INF] Scratch: magic=bad, copy_done=0x5, image_ok=0xcf
[INF] Boot source: slot 0
[INF] Swap type: none
[INF] Bootloader chainload address offset: 0x80000
[INF] Jumping to the first image slot
[Sec Thread] Secure image initializing!
```

#### Regression tests

After completing the procedure you should be able to visualize on the serial
port (baud 115200 8n1) the following messages:

```
[INF] Starting bootloader
[INF] Image 0: magic=good, copy_done=0xff, image_ok=0xff

## Execute TF-M example and regression tests on Musca test chip boards ##

Note: Before executing any images on Musca-B1 board, please check the readme
under platform/ext/target/musca_b1 to have the correct setup.

#### Example application with BL2 bootloader

1. Create a unified hex file comprising of both `mcuboot.bin` and `tfm_sign.bin`
  * For Musca-A
    * Windows
    `srec_cat.exe bl2\ext\mcuboot\mcuboot.bin -Binary -offset 0x200000 tfm_sign.bin -Binary -offset 0x220000 -o tfm.hex -Intel`
    * Linux
    `srec_cat bl2/ext/mcuboot/mcuboot.bin -Binary -offset 0x200000 tfm_sign.bin -Binary -offset 0x220000 -o tfm.hex -Intel`
  * For Musca-B1
    * Windows
    `srec_cat.exe bl2\ext\mcuboot\mcuboot.bin -Binary -offset 0xA000000 tfm_sign.bin -Binary -offset 0xA020000 -o tfm.hex -Intel`
    * Linux
    `srec_cat bl2/ext/mcuboot/mcuboot.bin -Binary -offset 0xA000000 tfm_sign.bin -Binary -offset 0xA020000 -o tfm.hex -Intel`
2. Power up the Musca board by connecting it to a computer with a USB lead.
   Press the `PBON` button if the green `ON` LED does not immediately come on.
   The board should appear as a USB drive.
3. Copy `tfm.hex` to the USB drive. The orange `PWR` LED should start blinking.
4. Once the `PWR` LED stops blinking, power cycle or reset the board to boot
   from the new image.
5. After completing the procedure you should see the following messages on the
   DAPLink UART (baud 115200 8n1):

```
[INF] Starting bootloader
[INF] Image 0: magic=good, copy_done=0xff, image_ok=0xff
[INF] Scratch: magic=bad, copy_done=0x5, image_ok=0xd9
[INF] Boot source: slot 0
[INF] Swap type: none
[INF] Bootloader chainload address offset: 0x20000
[INF] Jumping to the first image slot
[Sec Thread] Secure image initializing!
```

#### Regression tests with BL2 bootloader

After completing the procedure you should see the following messages on the
DAPLink UART (baud 115200 8n1):

```
[INF] Starting bootloader
[INF] Image 0: magic=good, copy_done=0xff, image_ok=0xff
[INF] Scratch: magic=bad, copy_done=0x5, image_ok=0x9

```

#### Example application or regression tests on Musca-B1 without BL2 bootloader
Follow the above procedures, but create a unified hex file out of `tfm_s.bin`
and `tfm_ns.bin`:

* Windows
`srec_cat.exe app\secure_fw\tfm_s.bin -Binary -offset 0xA000000 app\tfm_ns.bin -Binary -offset 0xA060000 -o tfm.hex -Intel`
* Linux
`srec_cat app/secure_fw/tfm_s.bin -Binary -offset 0xA000000 app/tfm_ns.bin -Binary -offset 0xA060000 -o tfm.hex -Intel`

## Firmware upgrade and image validation with BL2 bootloader
