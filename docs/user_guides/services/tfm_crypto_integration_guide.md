# TF-M Crypto Service Integration Guide

## Introduction

TF-M Crypto service allows application to use cryptography primitives such as
symmetric and asymmetric ciphers, hash, message authentication codes (MACs) and
authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD).

## Code structure

The PSA interfaces for the Crypto service are located in `interface\include`.
The only header to be included by applications that want to use functions from
the PSA API is `psa_crypto.h`.
The TF-M Crypto service source files are located in `secure_fw\services\crypto`.

### PSA interfaces

The TF-M Crypto service exposes the PSA interfaces detailed in the header
`psa_crypto.h`. There are two additional header files, named
`psa_crypto_extra.h` and `psa_crypto_platform.h`, which are meant to be included
only by the `psa_crypto.h` header itself, that specify, respectively, extensions
to the API that are vendor specific, and provide definitions and types which are
platform specific. For a detailed description of the PSA API interface, please
refer to the comments in the `psa_crypto.h` header itself.

### Service source files

 - `crypto_cipher.c` : This file implements functionalities related to the
 ciphering module;
 - `crypto_hash.c` : This file implements functionalities related to the
 hashing module;
 - `crypto_init.c` :  This file provides basic functions to initialise the
 secure service during TF-M boot;
 - `crypto_key.c` : This file implements functionalities related to the key
 management module. The `TFM_CRYPTO_KEY_STORAGE_NUM`, defined in this file,
 determines how many key stores are available (4 key stores for the current
 implementation);
 - `crypto_alloc.c` : This file implements extensions to the PSA interface
 which are specifically required by the TF-M Crypto service, in particular
 related to the allocation and deallocation of crypto operation contexts in
 the secure world. The `TFM_CRYPTO_CONC_OPER_NUM`, defined in this file,
 determines how many concurrent contexts are supported (8 for the current
 implementation). For multipart cipher/hash/MAC operations, a context is
 associated to the handle provided during the setup phase, and is explicitly
 cleared only following a successful termination or an abort;
 - `crypto_wrappers.c` : This file implements TF-M compatible wrappers in
 case they are needed by the functions exported by other modules;
 - `crypto_utils.c` : This file implements utility functions that can be
 used by other modules of the TF-M Crypto service;
 - `crypto_engine.c` : This file implements the layer which the other modules
 use to interact with the cryptography primitives available (in SW or HW).
 The current implementation provides only SW primitives based on Mbed TLS
 functions;
 - `crypto_mac.c` : This file implements functionalities related to the
 MAC (Message Authentication Code) module;
 - `crypto_aead.c` : This file implements functionalities related to the AEAD
 (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) module.

## Crypto service integration guide

In this section, a brief description of the required flow of operation for the
functionalities exported by the PSA Crypto interface is given, with particular
focus on the TF-M Crypto service specific operations. For the details of the
generic PSA Crypto interface operations, please refer directly to the header
`psa_crypto.h`.

Most of the PSA Crypto APIs require an operation context to be allocated by the
application and then to be passed as a pointer during the following API calls.
These operation contexts are of four main types describes below:

 - `psa_key_policy_t` - Operation context to be used when setting key policies;
 - `psa_hash_operation_t` - Operation context for multipart hash operations;
 - `psa_mac_operation_t` - Operation context for multipart MAC operations;
 - `psa_cipher_operation_t` - Operation context for multipart cipher operations.

The user applications are not allowed to make any assumption about the original
types behind these typedefs, which are defined inside `psa_crypto.h`.
In the scope of the TF-M Crypto service, these types are regarded as
handles to the corresponding implementation defined structures which are stored
in the Secure world.
